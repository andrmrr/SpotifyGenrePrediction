The project is separated into diferent notebooks, which they need to be runned in a specific order.
Assuming the user has access to the same google drive folder as the developers (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T-QbzDiMJHy_QTBV-LvBwRRlr_M-3qEv?usp=sharing), they do not need to apply any modifications and just run the notebooks in this order:

1: ML_Preprocess.ipynb
2: Imbalance.ipynb
3: Decision_tree-LDA-KNN-SVM.ipynb
4: GNB_LR_extraTrees_MLP.ipynb
5: QDA_RandomForest.ipynb
6: Clustering
7: VotingStacking.ipynb
8: Compare_models_val.ipynb

The user can skip the the two first steps if they do not wish to rerun the preprocessing steps again and use the data in the "data" folder.
In case the user does not have acces to the drive, they will have to change the routes from the notebooks to the one from a directory of their choice.
If for some reason the google drive was not share succesfully, please contact us.
